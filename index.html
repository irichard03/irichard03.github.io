                <p>I'm an aspiring web developer and IT support specialist working for Stewart Title out of their Bissonnet office in Houston, Texas.  I graduated from Texas A & M university in 2004 with a Bachelor of Arts in English.  Past employers have included: 84 lumber, Pennsylvania Power and Light, Harte-Hanks, National Financial Partners, Pearson Education, and most recently Stewart Title.</p>
                
                <p>I'm a huge sci-fi/fantasy nerd, and gamer.  I'd be playing Total War-Warhammer right now if I wasn't busy doing homework for this class.  I'm interested in web-development as it directly applies to my current work, and I am aslo interested in freelance work on the side.  I'm especially interested in gaming and small business applications.</p>
